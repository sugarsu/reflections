How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It is easier to spot the difference visually, it's like pattern matching/recognition, what our eyes do every day.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You don't have to remember all the changes you have made to one file.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Sometimes you're not sure of a change and it is not something you want to save.
	But then again, sometimes you can forget to commit a change that you could loose if power goes off, for instance.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Sometimes you need to save a change that involves several documents that relate to one context.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log shows the history of changes distributed in commits with their corresponding commit id and message. Diff shows the changes made between given two commit ids.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It allows you to undo your changes in case of mistake.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    all kinds of projects.
