When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you want to share your project with other people or to collaborate in any other project.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because maybe you are not ready to have all those changes available for sharing.
