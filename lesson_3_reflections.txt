When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you want to share your project with other people or to collaborate in any other project.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because maybe you are not ready to have all those changes available for sharing.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	A branch is useful when you want to experiment and maintain the main content available and working for other people collaborating in it or maintain a working branch for yourself.
	A clone is a copy of a repository that can be made from a GitHub repository or from a local repository in local. It contains all the commit history.
	A fork is a clone of a repository from Github in the same Github.
	
	
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	You can have the changes from github repository offline, in the local repository.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	It depends on the project. It would be easier to handle very small changes, but if here are several changes, and/or big, and/or from several collaborators, then it would become harder to merge the changes.
