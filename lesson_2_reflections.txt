What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git starts to track changes on all the contents of the directory. 
It creates a .git file with information of the changes.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is a a place where you can group several files that relate to a same " logical"  change.
The working directory...contains all the files you are working with, whether they are in the staging area, comitted or not.
The repository contains the files from the working directory that have been committed.
